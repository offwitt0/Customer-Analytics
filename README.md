# Customer Analytics Project

## Overview

This project focuses on **Customer Analytics**, diving into key concepts like segmentation, targeting, positioning, marketing mix, price elasticity, and applying advanced techniques like neural networks. The project is divided into two main parts:

1. **Customer Segmentation**: Using hierarchical and flat clustering techniques.
2. **Purchase Analytics**: Exploring descriptive and predictive analytics of customer purchase behavior.

## Project Breakdown

### 1. Customer Segmentation
In this section, we:
- Perform customer segmentation using various clustering techniques.
- Apply **Hierarchical Clustering** and **K-means** to divide customers into meaningful groups.
- Use **Principal Components Analysis (PCA)** to reduce the dimensionality of the data.
- Combine **PCA** with **K-means** to improve the accuracy and professionality of the segmentation process.

### 2. Purchase Analytics
This section focuses on:
- Understanding customer purchase behavior through both **descriptive** and **predictive** analytics.
- Models for **purchase incidence**, **brand choice**, and **purchase quantity**.
- Applying **deep learning techniques** for purchase prediction using real-world datasets.

### Key Techniques & Tools
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: A method of cluster analysis that builds a hierarchy of clusters.
- **K-means Clustering**: A flat clustering technique that divides data into *K* pre-defined clusters.
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: A dimensionality reduction technique that transforms high-dimensional data into lower dimensions.
- **Neural Networks**: Used to predict customer behavior based on past purchase data.
- **Descriptive & Predictive Models**: Analyzing purchase behavior patterns.
